# OpenAugI (Open Augmented Intelligence)

(pronounced "Open Augie")

Augmented Intelligence for your second brain.

## Our Mission

We're building an open, privacy-first ecosystem of knowledge tools that augment human intelligence while keeping users in control of their data and ideas.

We believe knowledge tools should serve the people who use them, not extract value from them.

We're creating technology that helps people capture, process, connect, and utilize their knowledge while respecting their privacy and ownership.


## Core Values
- **People First**: Humans over machines. We go further together.
- **Privacy as Foundation**: Take back your data. Write your own story.
- **Open by Default**: All code released under MIT license for personal use.
- **Aligned Incentives**: Business model that balances mission with sustainability - thinking Mozilla's steward model in the future.
- **Composable Ecosystem**: Building blocks that work together. Innovation happens quick, swap pieces when needed.
- **Augment, Stay Human**: Amplify your unique self, use LLMs as a tool to go faster.

## Current Projects

We're in the early stages of development, working on:

- Taking a voice note and hierarchically distilling it to atomic notes
- De-duplicating by embedding clustering
- Merging it to an existing knowledge graph (explict links and semantically)

Check the [`experiments/`](./experiments/) folder for our latest prototypes.
