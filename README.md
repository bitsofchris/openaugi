# OpenAugI (Open Augmented Intelligence)

(pronounced "Open Augie")

> Augmented intelligence for everyone, built in the open

## Our Mission

We're building an open, privacy-first ecosystem of knowledge tools that augment human intelligence while keeping users in control of their data and ideas.

We believe knowledge tools should serve the people who use them, not extract value from them. We're creating technology that helps people capture, process, connect, and utilize their knowledge while respecting their privacy and ownership.

Augmented Intelligence for your second brain.

## Core Values

- **People First**: Community and relationships at the center
- **Privacy as Foundation**: All processing happens locally, users own their data
- **Open by Default**: All code released under MIT license
- **Aligned Incentives**: Business model that balances mission with sustainability (TBD)
- **Composable Ecosystem**: Building blocks that work together
- **Personal Empowerment**: Tools that enhance thinking, not replace it

## Current Projects

We're in the early stages of development, working on:

- **Voice Note Distiller**: Extract key concepts, tasks, and insights from voice notes
- **Knowledge Mapper**: Connect ideas across your personal knowledge base
- **Local-First Processing**: Privacy-respecting infrastructure for personal data

Check the [`experiments/`](./experiments/) folder for our latest prototypes.
