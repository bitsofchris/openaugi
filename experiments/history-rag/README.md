# Personal AUGmented Intelligence (PAUGI)

Using AI + your data for self-improvement. To help you see things you can't see.

This "history-rag" experiment will take a list of events (ie. tagged blocks or curated events) and cross-reference it with the rest of your data by looking for more context before/after the given events.

The LLM can then help look for patterns, distill relevant info, and surface things that you may have missed.
